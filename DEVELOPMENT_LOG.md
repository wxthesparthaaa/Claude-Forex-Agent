## 2026-08-10 — Initial build

**Problem**: No system existed yet. Needed a forex trading agent for OANDA
(practice account) covering the 7 major USD pairs plus gold/silver/oil,
with a human-approval-first workflow and a staged path toward supervised
autopilot.

**Solution**: Built the full pipeline in one extended session — OANDA
client + risk-correct position sizing, currency-strength/breadth signal,
pivot/structure-break detection with multi-timeframe confluence, RSI +
candlestick annotation, a weighted confidence score, Finnhub news
integration, a live dashboard, a backtest engine, Telegram notifications
(9:30pm listing / 1am review / Friday reflection), autopilot phase
gating, and GitHub-Contents-API state sync so Render's free-tier disk
wipe on every redeploy doesn't lose settings or trade history.

**Bugs found and fixed the same day**:
- **~150x under-sized risk on USD_JPY** — a missing currency conversion
  in position sizing meant risk was computed in the wrong currency
  entirely. Root-caused by reading a sibling project's working
  implementation rather than guessing; fixed with one shared conversion
  function, verified with a regression test using the exact numbers from
  the original bug.
- **News keyword substring bug** — "war" was matching inside "award".
  Caught by the test suite itself. Fixed with word-boundary matching.
- **Render start-command mismatch** — deploy kept using a placeholder
  command instead of `render.yaml`, because Blueprint config only
  auto-applies to Blueprint-created services.
- **GitHub token permission scope** — pushes were rejected with 403;
  traced to a fine-grained PAT missing "Contents: Read and write," not a
  bad credential.
- **UTF-8 BOM in a PowerShell-generated `.env`** silently corrupted the
  first environment variable's key name; fixed by loading with
  `encoding="utf-8-sig"`.
- **Win rate pie chart showed nothing** — it was fed hardcoded
  `wins=0, losses=0` instead of real journal data.
- **Manual trade flow built from a wrong interpretation** — removed same
  day once the actual requirement was clarified, rather than left as
  dead code.
- **Scan Now silently produced nothing** — two separate causes (both
  verified live): a stale scan-results path and a swallowed exception.
- **Execute button 500 error** — SL/TP prices weren't rounded to the
  instrument's tick size before sending the order to OANDA.
- **Duplicate order execution risk** — no guard existed against a
  double-click or a retried request placing the same trade twice; added
  before this ever caused a real duplicate.
- **Excel journal export crash** — a string/float type mismatch when a
  field was empty.
- **"Amount traded" showed a meaningless figure** — clarified to actual
  notional value with the correct currency label per instrument.

## 2026-08-11 — Reliability under real usage

**Problem**: Once the app was in daily use, three separate reliability
issues surfaced: the nightly review was reporting P&L from trades this
app never placed, Scan Now was 502'ing intermittently, and the fixed-time
Telegram schedule silently skipped its touchpoint whenever Render's
free-tier process happened to be asleep at the exact scheduled minute.

**Solution**:
- Nightly review switched from `client.get_closed_trades()` (broker-wide,
  swept in unrelated demo-account activity — one real incident reported
  "50 closed trades, +452% P&L" when only 5 trades had actually been
  placed) to reading this app's own local trade journal.
- Root-caused the 502s to Render redeploying on every state-sync commit
  (state writes were landing on the same `main` branch Render watches for
  deploys).
- Replaced fixed-minute `CronTrigger`s with a 5-minute dispatcher that
  checks a persisted per-touchpoint date-stamp, so whichever tick happens
  to be the first one after the process wakes back up runs the touchpoint
  that was missed, instead of silently skipping it for the day.
- Added trading-window guidance (per-pair best session) to the Friday
  reflection message.

**Fixed**: 2026-08-11 23:52 SGT

## 2026-08-12 — Position-sizing safety and data-completeness bugs

**Problem**: A batch of real incidents surfaced from live usage: Finnhub
news calls were piling up and slowing every scan; state-sync commits were
still triggering redeploys in some cases; and — the most serious one — a
near-zero-pip stop from a shallow swing pivot was producing an enormous
position size that got silently *clamped* to a 200,000-unit cap instead
of being rejected, meaning a $2,000 account could end up massively
over-leveraged on a single trade.

**Solution**:
- Cached Finnhub news fetches (5-minute TTL) to stop the 502 pile-up.
- Fully separated state-sync commits from code-deploy commits at the
  branch level, not just the build-filter level.
- **Changed `calculate_units()` to reject (`return 0`) rather than clamp**
  when the risk-correct position size exceeds the cap — this was the
  most safety-critical fix of the week.
- Added `MIN_STOP_DISTANCE_PIPS` as an explicit floor, rejecting
  degenerate near-zero-pip stops before they ever reach position sizing.
- Fixed a trade that got stuck showing OPEN forever once enough other
  trades had closed since it did (`get_closed_trades(count=50)` was a
  bounded window that aged old trades out of visibility).
- Fixed Scan Now crashing the entire scan (not just one instrument) when
  OANDA doesn't list a direct pair for a currency cross (e.g. JPY/SGD).
- Stopped retrying a trade lookup forever when OANDA has no record of the
  trade at all (a genuine 404, not a transient error).
- Wired up the economic calendar feature and added a Telegram source
  header; fixed a mobile chart overflow.

**Fixed**: 2026-08-12 22:16 SGT (critical position-sizing fix); remaining
items same day

## 2026-08-13 — Removing what didn't work, journaling for self-reflection

**Problem**: The Finnhub economic-calendar endpoint turned out to be
paid-tier only and was 403'ing constantly, adding clutter and noise for
no working feature. Separately, the trade journal recorded outcomes
(P&L, TP/SL) but discarded the confidence-score breakdown that produced
each trade before it was ever written down — meaning there was no way to
later ask "was this a news-driven signal or a structure-driven one" once
a trade had already closed.

**Solution**: Removed the economic-calendar feature entirely (kept the
working news-sentiment scoring, which is a separate code path). Started
journaling `confidence_components` on every closed trade, so the data
needed for a future self-reflection/tuning process actually exists going
forward instead of being thrown away.

**Fixed**: 2026-08-13 23:14 SGT

## 2026-08-14 — Duplicate-message root cause (first pass), news-relevance widening, and an honest look at whether the strategy has an edge

**Problem**: Real incident — duplicate Telegram messages ("Manual mode
on" shown even when the dashboard read Autopilot on), traced to two
scheduled jobs racing to call the same scan-and-notify function on the
same 5-minute tick, plus a GitHub 409 conflict silently dropping a
settings save with no retry.

**Solution**: Added a non-blocking lock so a losing concurrent call
returns immediately instead of racing the winner; added retry-with-
refetch on a GitHub 409; changed the evening-listing send to re-read the
phase fresh immediately before sending rather than reusing a
scan-start snapshot.

**Also this day**: widened news-sentiment currency matching (ISO codes,
country/demonym names — a headline like "Canada Manufacturing Sales"
previously matched nothing) and added actual-vs-forecast beat/miss
inference for indicator types with an unambiguous direction (jobs,
retail sales, GDP, trade balance — deliberately excluding CPI, where a
beat can read either way depending on macro regime).

**The bigger question**: after 10 consecutive scans found zero
qualifying setups, built a rigorous walk-forward backtest (no lookahead)
to find out whether the entry filter itself still made sense, rather
than just loosening a threshold. Tested over 413 days across all 11
instruments: **no combination of instrument selection, scan-time window,
confidence-score gate, or R:R ratio showed a real, temporally-stable
edge** — and a check of the raw structure-break direction call itself
came back at 46–49% accuracy, no better than a coin flip. Screened four
alternate signal families (EMA crossover, RSI mean-reversion, Bollinger
mean-reversion, breakout continuation); only Bollinger mean-reversion
looked promising on a cheap directional screen, but a full walk-forward
simulation with real stop/TP execution showed that edge did not survive
either. A mechanical backtest of a well-known discretionary price-action
strategy (daily-chart pin bars at key levels with trend confluence) also
came back with negative expectancy at every R-multiple target tested.
Documented honestly rather than shipped as a "fix" — this was a research
finding, not a bug.

**Fixed**: 2026-08-14 21:46–21:49 SGT (duplicate-message root cause,
first pass)

## 2026-08-15 — Duplicate-message root cause (full fix), per-pair Autopilot windows, weekly self-improvement, dashboard usability

**Problem**: Despite the 2026-08-14 fix, duplicate "Potential trades
tonight" messages kept recurring, including outside the intended
trading window and correlated with the app receiving traffic rather than
a fixed time of day. Investigated using the actual state-sync git
history rather than guessing, and found three independent, stacking
causes:
1. A function that scans (several seconds of network calls) held a
   `state` object loaded *before* the scan started, then saved that
   stale copy afterward — silently reverting completion flags that a
   different scheduled job had correctly set while the scan was still
   running.
2. The once-per-calendar-day gate could still be raced by overlapping
   process instances (most likely Render sleep/wake cycles), each
   independently passing the check before the other's write was visible.
3. APScheduler fires a freshly-registered job almost immediately by
   default — so every time Render's free tier put the process to sleep
   and a new request woke it back up, the scheduler re-registered and
   fired instantly, and a burst of wake-ups close together (e.g. from
   activity/traffic) could each produce their own unsynchronized first
   tick.

**Solution**: Three independent, stacking fixes — re-load state fresh
immediately before the function's own narrow save; a hard timestamp-based
dedupe backstop (a precise "last sent" time, re-checked against a
15-minute minimum gap, independent of which process/thread reaches the
send); and giving every scheduled job an explicit start time one full
interval in the future so a fresh process boot waits for its first
natural tick instead of firing instantly.

**Also this day**:
- **Per-pair Autopilot trading windows** — each instrument now
  scans/trades during its own conventional session (e.g. AUD/NZD during
  Sydney/Tokyo hours) instead of every pair sharing one fixed
  21:30–01:00 SGT slot, which previously gave AUD/NZD/JPY almost no
  benefit from Autopilot at all.
- **Weekly self-improvement** — the Friday reflection now automatically
  pauses (for 2 weeks, then re-evaluates fresh) any instrument that has
  closed net-negative for 3 traded weeks running. Deliberately
  downside-only — given the backtesting findings above, it never
  amplifies size or focus on a hot pair off a small sample.
- **Dashboard usability** — Last scan now shows when it actually ran;
  added a collapsed-by-default Developer Notes section; fixed the Last
  scan table breaking on narrow phone screens; added a clear prompt when
  Scan Now is used while forex markets are closed instead of a confusing
  empty result.

**Fixed**: 2026-08-15 11:50–14:14 SGT
